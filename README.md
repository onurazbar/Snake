# Snake

This is 2D snake game. Game software is developed via C++ using SFML. For more information about SFML please check the [link](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).


## Project Scheme

All source(.cpp) files are placed inside the source folder **src** and all header(.hpp) files are placed inside the folder **include**. Images that are used to create textures are placed inside the folder **image**. Fonts that are used for diplaying message box text are placed inside the folder **fonts**. There is also **GameView** folder that contains some game scenes but I do not prefer to add to the repo. So it is ignored inside gitignore. Besides there are also **Makefile** and **README** files.


## Build Instructions

There is a **Makefile** to compile the source codes, link object files with SFML files and create the executable game file. To build the project go to root directory **Snake** and simply type below command:

**make**
